    "description": "A winged people who originated on the Elemental Plane of Air, aarakocra soar through the sky wherever they wander. The first aarakocra served the Wind Dukes of Aaqa—mighty beings of air—and were imbued with a measure of their masters’ power over winds. Their descendants still command echoes of that power. From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Standing upright, aarakocra are typically about 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies—usually red, orange, yellow, brown, or gray. Their heads are also avian, often resembling those of parrots or eagles.",

Where they are known, the aarakocra rarely engage with the land-bound societies of Wildemount, though some take great pleasure in traveling on the open ocean with Concord sailors and Revelry pirates. Some legends say that Melora the Wild Mother created the aarakocra as storm herders who drive the clouds across the sky, and some aarakocra tribes play a sport called h’aara-shie , or “cloud chasing,” that reflects this ancient tale.",

    "description": "The serpent creatures known as yuan-ti are all that remains of an ancient, decadent human empire. Centuries ago, their days as a great civilization ended when the serpent gods they worshiped demanded a foul sacrifice: the yuan-ti\u2019s humanity. Through a ritual that warped their bodies and minds, the people of this empire became snake-like monstrosities. Purebloods are the most human-seeming of all yuan-ti breeds, often blending into human society to further the goals of their kind.",
